The lake is named after the ancient Sastha temple (a pilgrimage centre) located on its bank. It meets the drinking water needs of half million people of the Quilon district and also provides fishing resources. The purity of the lake water for drinking use is attributed to the presence of large population of larva called cavaborus that consumes bacteria in the lake water.[2] The lake is a designated wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention since November 2002.Being called the 'Queen of Lakes' is no small distinction, but a visit to Sasthamkotta in Kollam district helps you understand the moniker.

One can find friendly monkeys on its premises that are considered divine entities by the locals. Dedicated to both Lord Ganesha and Lord Ayyappa, the monkeys are believed to be the faithful entourage of the ruling deity, the Dharmasastha.People love coming and feeding the beautiful animals, along with soaking in the spiritual ambience of the entire place.Sasthamkotta or Sasthamcotta is a village in the Kunnathoor Tehsil of Kollam district in the state of Kerala, India. </p>
