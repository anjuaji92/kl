                Trivandrum Tourism
            The capital city of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram or Trivandrum, is an appealing blend of a strongly rooted heritage and a nostalgic colonial legacy. Built upon seven hills, this city has long since left the days when it was only used by seafaring explorers behind - today, Trivandrum is an expensive metropolis with quaint urban charm and plenty of architectural and historical places to visit. In addition, Trivandrum is a gateway to nearby popular beach towns of Kovalam and Varkala.
            
            The Padmanabhaswamy temple (also known as Anantha Padmanabhaswamy temple) is a must-visit temple of India. Other famous temples in Trivandrum include the Attukal Bhagawati temple, the Aazhimala Siva Temple, the Karikkakom Chamundi Devi Temple, and the Pazhavangadi Ganapathy Temple.
            
            The city is home to a few museums, such as the Kuthiramalika Palace Museum and the Napier Museum. The Kuthiramalika Palace Museum is situated close-by to the Padmanabhaswamy temple. Renowned for its Travancore styled architectural features and its structural elegance, this museum houses priceless paintings, traditional furniture, and other royal family collections.
